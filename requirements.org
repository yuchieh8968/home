* Explore HTML and CSS
** Description

   You will get experience with existing HTML and CSS and you will
   make some of your own as well.

** Collaboration
   - You may consult with others but the submission should be your
     own source code.
   - Collaboration but document it in the README.md file
   - Any external source code must be referenced and documented in
     the README.md file

** Part I

   Add 1 CSS to 3 project Gutenberg documents that have more than 3
   chapters each.

   Change the look and feel of 3 project Gutenberg HTML documents of your
   choosing, I recommend making the documents look old using serif
   fonts use yellowish or paper-like backgrounds:

   http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

   Some of these books are archaic and subscribe to archaic and
   outdated values. If they offend you, choose something else from
   the Gutenberg catalogue.

*** Requirements

    - [ ] Theme paragraphs with CSS
    - [ ] Theme header tags with CSS
    - [ ] Theme images and images captions with CSS
    - [ ] Change the colour scheme to something aesthetically pleasing
    - [ ] Apply 1 CSS file to 3 gutenberg documents.
    - [ ] Include all 3 gutenberg documents HTML and assets, with the CSS applied.
    - [ ] document in your README what modifications you had to make
      to the project gutenberg HTML files.
    - [ ] Take 3 screenshots of firefox running all of your pages that
      demonstrates your theme.

** Part II 

   You're going to make your own HTML page and you're going to make 2
   CSS themes for it.

   Emulate the 2nd and 3rd design from this comic: 
   http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell

   Make 1 good page that you could show an employer. Make 1 bad papge that you would show your friends because it is funny.

   Include at least 3 sections:

   Who you are + photo

   Your professional history

   What you can do for a potential employer/what you have to offer

   Then a sidebar of important points they should know about you.

   Make 1 ugly CSS and 1 good CSS just like the design_hell comic.

   You should make a page good enough you'd actually use it as your homepage.

   If you do not want to disclose personal information then you have to make up the missing information and you do not have to personally identify yourself. If this is too hard then go on Wikipedia and find a famous figure you like and make a webpage for them. I expect the quality of "fake" or biography webpages to be of equal quality to an autobiographical webpage.

*** Requirements

    - [ ] 4 sections: who you are, your history, what you have to
      offer, important points about you
    - [ ] 1 Ugly CSS theme
    - [ ] 1 good CSS theme
    - [ ] Ugly theme has to be noticeabley different.
    - [ ] 2 HTML files, each with the same content but different CSS
    - [ ] your photo (try to keep it professional)
    - [ ] Take 2 screenshots of firefox running all of your pages that
      demonstrates your theme.
    - [ ] Ensure that files are appropriately named and CASE SENSITIVE.
    - [ ] homepage/good.html should host your good page
    - [ ] homepage/ugly.html should host your ugly page
    - [ ] gutenberg/1.html should host your first gutenberg book
    - [ ] gutenberg/2.html should host your second gutenberg book
    - [ ] gutenberg/3.html should host your third gutenberg book
    - [ ] screenshots good.png, bad.png, gutenberg1.png, gutenberg2.png, gutenberg3.png should be in the root of the project.

     like CC-BY-ND or CC-BY-SA)

** Marking
   - Marks are given only when requirements are met.
   - Excellent 7/7: Project Gutenbergs are appropriately skinned.
     Everything is where it should be. The good page is presentable,
     the bad/ugly page is clearly bad or ugly. The CSS for your
     promotion pages look as close to theoatmeal comic as possible
     (don't steal his images).
   - Good 6/7: Project Gutenbergs are appropriately skinned.
     Everything is where it should be. Something is not excellent.
     Perhaps ugly page and good page look too similar. Perhaps something is
     broken in Firefox's rendering of your page.
   - Satisfactory 5/7: Project Gutenbergs are appropriately skinned.
     Some files aren't named properly and aren't where they should be.
     Something is not good. Perhaps ugly page and good page look too
     similar. Perhaps something is broken in Firefox's rendering of
     your page. Limited effort is apparent.
   - Unsatisfactory 3/7: There's some effort, all components are
     there. Screenshots are there but homepage is not right or
     gutenberg is not right.
   - Failure 0/7: Any submission with missing components: gutenbergs,
     screenshots, homepage

   Marks will be deducted for lack of screenshots and lack of README or wrong file locations.
